## About Me 
I born in 1998 in [_Esperanza_](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanza_(Santa_Fe)), Argentina, a small town of 45K inhabitants. I studied Chemical Technician in High School and Information System Engineer in College.

During my Middle and High School studies I participated in [_Olimpíada Matemática Argentina_](https://www.oma.org.ar/) and Olimpiada Argentina de Química, the math and chemistry national olympiads from Argentina.

During College I competed in ICPC and participated in the World Finals #46 and #48.
